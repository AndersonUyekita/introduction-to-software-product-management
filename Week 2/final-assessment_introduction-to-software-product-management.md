I have found the answers in the [Course
Notes.](https://github.com/AndersonUyekita/introduction-to-software-product-management/blob/main/resources/c1-course-notes-introduction-to-software-product-management.pdf)

## Question 1

From the course, what are the viewpoints to achieving better software?

-   [x] The right product, done right, and managed right.
-   [ ] The right product, the right timing, and the right funding.
-   [ ] The right product, the right client, and the right developers.
-   [ ] The right product, the right process, and the right people.

**Answer**

> One viewpoint aims to provide the right software product for the
> clients. A second viewpoint aims to have the software product done
> right. A third viewpoint aims to have the software project itself
> managed right.

To achieve better software, one viewpoint aims to have the right
product. What does having the right product mean?

## Question 2

-   [ ] The product functionality does not have defects.
-   [x] The client is satisfied that the product meets their needs.
-   [ ] The product conforms to the specified requirements.
-   [ ] The developers are satisfied with the product.

**Answer**

> That is, it meets their needs, solves their problem, and they are
> happy with it.

## Question 3

When we have the right software product, we say the software product is
\_\_\_\_.

-   [x] validated
-   [ ] verified
-   [ ] certified

**Answer**

> One viewpoint aims to provide the **right software product** for the
> clients. That is, it meets their needs, solves their problem, and they
> are happy with it. That is, **the software product is validated**.

## Question 4

To achieve better software, another viewpoint aims to have the product
done right. What ways can developers achieve that? Choose two of the
following:

-   [ ] Developers request a list of requirements from the client.
-   [ ] Developers show the product to the client to see if it meets
    their needs.
-   [x] Developers run tests to check whether the product conforms to
    the specified requirements.
-   [x] Developers review the requirements so that they are clear and
    consistent.

**Answer**

> A second viewpoint aims to have **the software product done right**.
> The software implementation conforms to a specified design, and in
> turn, the design satisfies a stated set of requirements. Developers
> can conduct reviews and tests to ensure the requirements, design, and
> implementation line up and do not have defects. That is, the software
> product is verified.

## Question 5

What is the primary agile principle that can lead to better software
products and project success?

-   [ ] Working software is delivered every six months to allow time for
    more changes.
-   [x] The customer is satisfied with the early and continuous delivery
    of valuable software.
-   [ ] Information is conveyed effectively in the development team
    through instant messaging.
-   [ ] The best designs emerge from teams that follow a visionary
    leader.

**Answer**

> Early and Continuous Delivery: Our highest priority is to satisfy the
> customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.

## Question 6

The Manifesto for Agile Software Development puts more value on:

-   [ ] individuals and interactions, working software, and following a
    plan.
-   [ ] working software, customer collaboration, and processes and
    tools.
-   [ ] customer collaboration, responding to change, and comprehensive
    documentation.
-   [x] responding to change, individuals and interactions, and working
    software.

**Answer**

> Four core values define the Agile philosophy for software development.
>
> -   **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools
> -   **Working software** over comprehensive documentation
> -   **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation
> -   **Responding to change** over following a plan

## Question 7

When the Manifesto for Agile Software Development says it values
responding to change over following a plan, it means

-   [ ] plan for change for more value.
-   [ ] plans can change, so they have less value.
-   [ ] changing plans are valued more.
-   [x] responding to change is valued more than following a plan.

**Answer**

> -   Responding to change over following a plan

## Question 8

As an Agile principle, what is harnessed for the customer’s competitive
advantage?

-   [ ] simplicity
-   [x] change
-   [ ] valuable software
-   [ ] motivated individuals

**Answer**

> Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile
> processes harness change for the customer’s competitive advantage.

## Question 9

What does a software process organize?

-   [ ] It organizes how software operates on information in distinct
    phases.
-   [ ] It organizes how the work of people is assisted with software to
    develop products.
-   [ ] It organizes how software products help people to do work in
    phases.
-   [x] It organizes how the work of people happens in distinct phases
    to develop a software product.

**Answer**

> A process organizes the work of people into distinct high-level phases
> or stages to develop a software product.

## Question 10

In this specialization, what are software requirements?

-   [ ] They are specific descriptions of what your client wants.
-   [ ] They are specific descriptions of what your client needs in
    order to run the software.
-   [ ] They are specific hardware that the software needs to run.
-   [x] They are specific descriptions of your client’s needs.

**Answer**

> In software, requirements are a set of specific descriptions to help
> capture your client’s needs.

## Question 11

Clear expressions of software requirements are important to help
\_\_\_\_\_.

-   [x] avoid confusion between the client and developers
-   [ ] the client express themselves clearly
-   [ ] ensure the software requirements are legible by those with poor
    eyesight
-   [ ] produce transparent effects in the user interface of a software
    product

**Answer**

> Clear requirements are important. Ambiguous requirements can create
> confusion among the development team and with the client. Avoiding
> confusion is an important part of the software product manager’s role.

## Question 12

Planning initially involves using information from \_\_\_ for developers
to devise needed tasks and make time estimates.

-   [x] requirements
-   [ ] calendars
-   [ ] schedules
-   [ ] delivery targets

**Answer**

> Planning involves organizing tasks and schedules to align software
> development activities with requirements, in order to make timely
> progress through the phases of the development process.

## Question 13

What are direct benefits or outcomes of using planning?

-   [ ] risks are managed; plans are fixed; tasks are assigned
-   [ ] requirements are defined; task times are estimated; tasks are
    assigned
-   [ ] risks are identified; risks are monitored; overcommitment can be
    avoided
-   [x] tasks are determined; tasks are assigned; schedules are created

**Answer**

> Planning involves organizing tasks and schedules to align software
> development activities with requirements, in order to make timely
> progress through the phases of the development process. Creating tasks
> and schedules requires identifying who should do the work, and
> estimating how long that work will take.

## Question 14

You need to effectively monitor, analyze, and review the progress of
your project, so you:

-   [x] monitor velocity to help in continuously adjusting plans.
-   [ ] use your gut feelings to assess the project status.
-   [ ] can boost morale before crunch time comes.
-   [ ] track ongoing work to ensure management knows the status.

**Answer**

> When things change in the project (and they will change), it’s
> important to have an idea of what’s going on in the project, so that
> you can deal with these changes as effectively as possible.
