## Question 2

The Manifesto for Agile Software Development specifically says it values
\_\_\_\_ over comprehensive documentation?

-   [ ] responding to change
-   [ ] customer collaboration
-   [ ] individuals and interactions
-   [x] working software

**Answer**

> -   Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
> -   **Working software over comprehensive documentation**
> -   Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
> -   Responding to change over following a plan

## Question 3

The Manifesto for Agile Software Development says it values \_\_\_\_
less.

-   [ ] customer collaboration
-   [x] following a plan
-   [ ] individuals and interactions
-   [ ] working software

**Answer**

> The Agile philosophy values the items on the left more than the items
> on the right. This is not to suggest that you ignore processes and
> tools, comprehensive documentation, contract negotiation, or
> **following a plan**. It is merely that the items on the left are the
> more important things to focus on

> -   Responding to change over following a plan

## Question 4

As an Agile principle, what is the primary measure of progress in the
project?

-   [x] working software
-   [ ] sustainable development
-   [ ] technical excellence
-   [ ] satisfying the customer

**Answer**

> -   Working Prototypes as Progress: Working Software is the primary
>     measure of progress.

## Question 5

In a software process, in which phase do you determine what the software
is expected to do?

-   [ ] design and implementation
-   [ ] planning
-   [ ] verification and validation
-   [x] specification

**Answer**

> **Specification** activities discover and define **what the software
> is expected to do**. **Design and implementation** activities
> structure and construct the software solution. **Verification and
> validation** activities test for potential defects and review whether
> the product meets the client’s needs.

## Question 6

What potential benefits does following a process for software
development have?

-   [ ] work expectations are set; poor designs are detected; resources
    are wasted
-   [x] responsibilities are defined; project are monitored; risks are
    managed
-   [ ] features are defined; ad hoc development is followed; defects
    are found
-   [ ] quality is improved; roles are defined; coding is from
    imagination

**Answer**

## Question 7

Spending time on refining software requirements primarily helps to
\_\_\_\_\_\_.

-   [x] detect potential misunderstandings in your product before it is
    built
-   [ ] show the implementation details of how the product works
    internally
-   [ ] polish the expression of the requirements, so no further edits
    are needed
-   [ ] ensure the software requirements are all known in the beginning

**Answer**

> By spending the time to refine requirements, you can also detect
> potential errors in your product before it’s even built

## Question 8

According to Alan Lakein, planning is about \_\_\_ so that you can do
something about it now.

-   [ ] bringing the past into the present
-   [x] bringing the future into the present
-   [ ] bringing the past into the future
-   [ ] bringing experience into the present

**Answer**

> something about it now.”
