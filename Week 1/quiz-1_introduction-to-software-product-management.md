## Question 1

What are examples of desirable characteristics that effective software
product management can help to achieve?

-   [x] having regular client demos; meeting client needs; having clear
    project progress
-   [ ] a satisfied client; having regular client demos; client writes
    automated tests
-   [ ] the client specifies requirements; demo is delivered at the end;
    satisfied developers
-   [ ] a satisfied client; the project is on time; lots of overtime
    hours for developers

**Answer** Based on first viewpoint:

> Developers can conduct **reviews and tests** to ensure the
> requirements, design, and implementation line up and do not have
> defects. That is, the software product is verified.

Based on second viewpoint:

> One viewpoint aims to provide the right software product for \*88**the
> clients. That is, it meets their needs**, solves their problem, and
> they are happy with it.

Based on third viewpoint:

> These practices ease communication and feedback, **so that everyone is
> clear on the next steps**. That is, the project is managed.

## Question 2

As a software product manager, you could be interacting with many
business units, such as the executive, marketing, and support. Day to
day, however, you mostly focus on representing the needs of two parties,
\_\_\_\_\_ and \_\_\_\_\_.

-   [x] client
-   [x] development team
-   [ ] CEO
-   [ ] end-user

**Answer**

> A software product manager needs a unique set of skills to assess
> whether the product is meeting **client** expectations, and to work
> with a **development team** to solve the client’s problems

## Question 3

When we have the software product done right, we say the software
product is \_\_\_\_.

-   [ ] validated
-   [ ] certified
-   [x] verified

**Answer**

-   Managed: the software project itself managed right ( The idea is to
    adopt just enough process and suitable practices to organize the
    work of everyone involved).
-   Verified: **the software product done right** (The software
    implementation conforms to a specified design, and in turn, the
    design satisfies a stated set of requirements). Also, Developers can
    conduct reviews and tests to ensure the requirements, design, and
    implementation line up and do not have defects.
-   Validated: the right software product for the clients (it meets
    their needs, solves their problem, and they are happy with it)

## Question 4

In the four foundational courses, what are the next two courses after
the introduction that are the basis for the “planning” course and
signified by the legs of an inukshuk?

-   [ ] Reviews and Metrics for Client Needs
-   [ ] Agile Planning for Software Products
-   [x] Software Processes and Agile Practices
-   [x] Client Needs and Software Requirements

**Answer**

The foundation “legs” of our specialization structure are the first two
courses:

1.  Software Process and Agile Practices
2.  Client Needs and Software Requirements
3.  Agile Planning for Software Products
4.  Reviews and Metrics for Software Improvement.
